= minitest-rails

MiniTest integration for Rails 3.1.

== Install

    gem install minitest-rails

This installs the following gems:

    minitest

== Configure

Create a new rails app without Test::Unit:

    rails new MyApp --skip-test-unit

Add `minitest-rails` to the `:test` and `:development` groups in Isolate:

    env :development, :test do
      gem 'minitest-rails'
    end

Or, for the unenlightened, add `minitest-rails` to the `:test` and `:development` groups in Gemfile:

    group :test, :development do
      gem 'minitest-rails'
    end

== Usage

We aim to expose MiniTest with minimal changes for testing within Rails.
You can either create test classes that inherit from MiniTest::Unit::TestCase or you can use the MiniTest::Spec DSL.
